This code was a Linear Regression assignment as part of my Foundations of Business Analytics module in my Masters.

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/nelsonchu/air-quality-in-northern-taiwan), and the code was written in R.

Context
This data is from Environmental Protection Administration, Executive Yuan, R.O.C. (Taiwan).

There is air quality data and meteorological monitoring data for research and analysis (only include northern Taiwan 2015).

Content
25 observation stations data in the 2015_Air_quality_in_northern_Taiwan.csv

The columns in csv file are:

time - The first column is observation time of 2015
station - The second column is station name, there is 25 observation stations
